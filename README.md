# python-template-test

Testing GitHub Repository Template functionality with an eye toward standardizing our approach with Python.

Ideally, using this repo as a template should give you the following for free:

> [ ] Enough of a file structure so that users can infer where they need to put their code, tests, etc.
> 
> [ ] Basic unit tests to guide testing patterns
> 
> [ ] Workflows to handle unit testing on push to the repo
> 
> [ ] `uv` support
> 
> [ ] A reasonable starting place for the pyproject.toml file
> 
> [ ] A README file the details what to do after you've cloned the repo
> 
> [ ] Variants for CLI tools and APIs (check out Typer to see if it'll meet needs, if so, FastAPI is probably the way to go)
> 
> [ ] A guide for publishing the package to PyPI
